# Implementing-Algorithms

## About this repo
I created this repo as a notepad to remember all the necessary data structures and algorithms that usually appears in interviews. This is so that I can go back and review it at any time during my career. I have also included other things such as Dynamic Programming and Backtracking as I am weaker in those areas. 

### Things yet to implement
- Bellman Ford Algorithm
- Ford Fulkerson Algorithm
- Max Flow Min Cut
- Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
- Prim's Algorithm
- Kruskal algorithm
- Minimum Spanning Tree
- Trie
