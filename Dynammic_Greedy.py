Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm - Create a program that finds the shortest path
through a graph using its edges.

Minimum Spanning Tree - Create a program which takes a connected,
undirected graph with weights and outputs the minimum spanning tree
of the graph i.e., a subgraph that is a tree, contains all the vertices,
and the sum of its weights is the least possible.
